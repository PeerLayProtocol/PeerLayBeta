    <h2 class="bottom-one">Overview</h2>
    <p class="bottom-three">PeerLay is a prediction game designed to prioritize user competition, fair rewards, and transparent gameplay. The game eliminates the need for intermediaries, empowering players to compete directly against one another. With its innovative scoring system, which values bold and strategic choices, PeerLay shifts the paradigm by rewarding overall performance relative to peers rather than just perfect predictions. </p>

    <h2 class="bottom-one">What do I need to play?</h2>
    <p class="bottom-one">- A Polygon-compatible web3 wallet. If you don't have one, we suggest downloading MetaMask.</p>
    <p class="bottom-one">- Some POL to pay for gas fees.</p>
    <p class="bottom-three">That's it. You will be able to cast 3 predictions per week that will win you PeerLay tokens.</p>

    <h2 class="bottom-one">Game Structure</h2>
    <p class="bottom-one">PeerLay is structured into weekly games. Each game features a unique set of events, with 3 to 6 events per game and 2 to 4 possible outcomes for each event</p>
    <p class="bottom-three">Games are divided into two distinct phases, with each phase lasting one week.</p>
    <strong class="bottom-one">Prediction Phase</strong> 
    <p class="bottom-three">During this phase, lasting one week, players can participate by casting their predictions on the events of the weekly game. For each event, players can select up to one option less than the total available choices (i.e., selecting all options for an event is not allowed). Players may also opt to skip an event entirely. Players are free to withdraw any prediction they have placed for the current game throughout the entire Prediction Phase.</p>
    <strong class="bottom-one">Results Phase</strong> 
    <p class="bottom-three">In the following phase, lasting one week again, casting or canceling predictions is not possbile anymore. In this phase, the events unfold, and the outcomes are finalized. Two days after the end of the second week, players will be able to withdraw their rewards. The rewards will be calculated according to probabilities, representing the choices made by players as a group.</p>
    <h2 class="bottom-one">Scoring System</h2>
    <p class="bottom-three">Scores will be calculated depending on final outcomes and their associated probabilities.</p>
    <strong class="bottom-one">Probabilities</strong> 
    <p class="bottom-one">The probabilities are calculated based on the frequency of selection for each available option across all players. For example, if an option has been selected 60 times and there is a total of 200 valid predictions for the event, the probability will be equal to 30% or 0.3</p>
    <p class="bottom-three">Probabilities will be defined only at the end of the prediction phase.</p>
    <strong class="bottom-one">Score Calculation</strong>
    <p class="bottom-one">Each prediction starts with a score equal to 1.</p> 
    <p class="bottom-one">If a player selects the correct outcome for an event, their score is divided (thereby increasing it) by the sum of the probabilities of the options they selected.</p>
    <p class="bottom-one">If the player's selected options do not include the correct outcome, their score is multiplied (thereby decreasing it) by the sum of the probabilities of the unselected options.</p>
    <p class="bottom-three">If the event was skipped, the score stays unchanged.</p> 

    <h2 class="bottom-one">Reward Calculation</h2>
    <p class="bottom-one">Rewards are determined by the player's Final Score.</p>
    <p class="bottom-three"><code>Reward = (Final Score × Total Prize) / Sum of Final Scores from All Players</code></p>

    <h2 class="bottom-one">Example</h2>
    <p class="bottom-one">We now see the case of a player placing a prediction on a game with 3 events.</p>
    <p class="bottom-one">They choose options B and C for event 1, they skip event 2, and they select options A and C for event 3.</p>
    <table class="bottom-one">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Event</th>
          <th colspan="4">Options</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Event 1</td>
          <td>Option A (30%)</td>
          <td class="selected">Option B (40%)</td>
          <td class="selected">Option C (10%)</td>
          <td>Option D (20%)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Event 2</td>
          <td>Option A (50%)</td>
          <td>Option B (20%)</td>
          <td>Option C (30%)</td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Event 3</td>
          <td class="selected">Option A (10%)</td>
          <td>Option B (80%)</td>
          <td class="selected">Option C (10%)</td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p class="bottom-one">All 3 events resolve to option A for the sake of simplicity.</p>
    <p class="bottom-one">The starting score is 1.</p>
    <p class="bottom-one"><strong> Event 1 (wrong prediction):</strong> 1 × (0.3 + 0.2) = <strong>0.5</strong> (The partial score is multiplied by the sum of the multipliers of the not selected options since the correct outcome was not selected)</p>
    <p class="bottom-one"><strong> Event 2 (event skipped):</strong> No change = <strong>0.5</strong> (The event was skipped by the player. no effect on the score)</p>
    <p class="bottom-three"><strong> Event 3 (right prediction):</strong> 0.5 / (0.1 + 0.1) = <strong>2.5</strong> (The partial score is divided by the sum of the multipliers of the selected options since the correct outcome was selected)</p>

    <p class="bottom-one">We consider a scenario in which the total available prize is 100 PeerLay tokens and the sum of the players' scores is 50.</p>
    <p class="bottom-three"><code>Reward = (2.5 × 100) / 50 = 5 tokens</code></p>
